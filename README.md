# Maze-Game

## Description
Maze-Game is a Python project that implements a visual maze solver using multiple search algorithms. 
The project allows users to visualize how different algorithms explore the maze and find the shortest path from start to goal. 
The supported algorithms include:

- **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**
- **DFS (Depth-First Search)**
- **A Star Search Algorithm**

The visualization is implemented using `pyMaze` library with colored agents representing exploration and final path.

## Features
- Generate or load a maze from CSV.
- Solve the maze using BFS, DFS, or A*.
- Visualize the exploration order of each algorithm.
- Display the final shortest path clearly.
- Show path length and search length statistics.
